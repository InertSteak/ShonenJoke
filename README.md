# ShonenJoke
Weekly Shonen Jump, now in Balatro Mod form!

## Currently the Mod Adds:
20 Jokers
1 Booster pack
1 Tag

## Overview

This is a small content mod that adds Jokers based around the manga running in the Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. Each Joker represents the main or a major character from that series and their abilities are flavored appropirately.
The intent is to have these Jokers at an in between rarity of Legendary and Rare. This allows some fun designs that can change up your run but aren't overcentralizing to gameplay. 

The gimmick with this mod is that Jokers will be kept at parity with the Weekly Shonen Jump Magazine which is regularly kept at 20 series. Thus Jokers will fall our of the pool as the series they are based on end. Of course, there's a config option for this and no jokers are actually removed, but I think its a fun option to have. Alien Headbutt is currently slated to debut in the magazine soon and I'll have a Joker for that one when I can. 

## Art Wanted
Right now there's pretty much no art assets for this mod as I am not visually/art inclined. If you want to contribute art feel free and I'll make sure you're credited.
